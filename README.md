## This is a small Github client application prototype for test purpose. 

### To run the application please follow steps below
- ```git clone git@github.com:asifsaho/github-client.git ``` use http link if you don't have *SSH*
- enter to the folder ``cd github-client``
- Download required libraries ``npm install``

### Due to CORS Issue we need a proxy server. I made a config already there is a folder in the in *github-client* folder called *cors-proxy*.
- Move to the directory ``cd cors-proxy``
- install the libraries ``npm install``
- Run proxy server ``node index.js`` 


### All set lets run the Application
- From another terminal tab enter to the *github-client* folder
- Run ``npm start`` and you will see the application on browser
- Login with your github account.
